C-language development in docker containers using some ubuntu version (22.04 (LTS) if nothing is defined in compose)

THIS IS THE UBUNTU_server FILE

Sources are kept in the host machine and project folder is mounted into the container. Building and running the software is done inside the containers. 

VS Code is used to edit the sources either using remote connection or inside the host os.
