"Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; 
		it was pale-green and luminous and wet. 
Its fingered end had hold of Frodo’s foot, 
		and was dragging him into the water. 
Sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife.
The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help. 
Twenty other arms came rippling out. 
		The dark water boiled, and there was a hideous stench."
—The Fellowship of the Ring, "A Journey in the Dark"
