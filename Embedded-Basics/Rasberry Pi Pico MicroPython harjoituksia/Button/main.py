# notice that components need GROUNDING
# for electricity to travel through them
# there is data pins and ground pins used

# when button is pressed, PULL_UP resistor of its datapin
# will reduce the volt from 3.3 to 0 volts
# because wires connect and electricity goes from datapin to ground
# thats why when button is pressed, button.value() == 0
